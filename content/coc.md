BSides Singapore has absolutely ZERO tolerance for physical, verbal and sexual harassment of any kind.

Our goal is to provide a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), education or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the organisers.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please do notify our core team or any volunteers accessible nearby. We take any complaints of harassment very seriously.

Be respectful and kind to each another. If someone asks you to stop, please do STOP! Keep basic decency and common sense that includes supporting speakers and volunteers who have committed their time to make BSides Singapore possible and successful.
